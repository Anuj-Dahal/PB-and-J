Recipe

1: Put both peices of bread on the plate
2: Take the first slice, and spread peanut butter on the side facing upwards. Only put peanut butter on that one side.
3: Take the second slice, and spread jelly or jam on the side facing upwards. Only put the jelly or jam on that one side.
4: Lift one of the slices, and put it face down on the other slice. You did it right if the jelly and peanut butter are touching each other in between the bread.

You are now done with the sandwich. Enjoy!
